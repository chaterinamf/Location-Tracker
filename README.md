# üìç Location Tracker Android App
An Android app that continuously collects and stores GPS pings ‚Äî even when the app is killed ‚Äî and visualizes them on a map and in a list view.  
The app is built with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Hilt (KSP)**, **Room**, **WorkManager**, and **Google Maps Compose**.
